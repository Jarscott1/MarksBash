# Welcome to MarksBash. We are making cool stuff here.
  The following project is to mitigate the time needed to creat documentation for code using scripts. The Bash script should be capable of seperating the documentation into categories base on headrs, functions, arguments, and ect. For an example reference the CPP.txt file. The HPP.txt is to test the script created for accuracy and precision. 
  Parameters to account for: Class, structs, and other datatypes
                            OOP documetation such as, Inheratence (Single / Multi), Encapsulation, and Polymorphism.
                            track number of instances.
